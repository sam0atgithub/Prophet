# Prophet

I use prophet to predict the number of views for a NBA player's wikipedia page. I show how to customize seasonality for NBA, including on-season/off-season difference, weekly and yearly seasonality, shocks (covid-19), holiday effects, customized holiday effects involving specific events (all-star, trade, draft day, awards).

Prophet is powerful in handling trends, seasonality, and holiday effects. Other implementations include but not limited to: supply chain management, 1-yr term sales forecast, multiple yr term sales forecast (useful in strategic plannning).

Growth models are also adjustable, in order to handle (dynamic) market size limitation, diminishing marginal benefit, new competitors, etc.
